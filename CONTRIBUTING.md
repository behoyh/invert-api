# Contributing

This project is open to any contributions, and they are very welcomed and apprecated!

I will probably approve your pull request, as long as it follows these loosely defined guidlines:

- **Style**: Make sure to follow SOLID priciples. Optimize for readability (even over perf), whenever possible. 
One of the intentions of this project is to to allow rapid customization, at least until an ad-hoc editor is put into place.
- **Scope**: The scope of this projectis currenly focused on in-app communication while a user has the app open.
Geo-marketing and external messages are considered out of scope. For a brief run-down on the general scope of Invert,
please vist my [blog](https://beshoyhanna.com/posts/UMGyoSZgLmleNWqCR1L2)

No tests are required at this time, although they may be added in the near future.

Please target your PR's to the `develop` branch.
